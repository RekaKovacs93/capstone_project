# Final Light

Final Light is an isometric, atmospheric, suspenseful, dark fantasy single player game where the player is the last light source in a world consumed by darkness.
The goal of each level is to find and activate the portal by completing challenges throughout the levels.

This game was developed using Unity and C# in two weeks (initial release) by a group of three CodeClan students who had no prior experience in developing games.
